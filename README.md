# OAuth 2.0 Resource Authorization Directive

Resource Authorization Directive (RAD) is a profile of OAuth 2.0.  RAD defines
how clients can discover which authorization server governs access to a
protected resource.  RAD also profiles existing OAuth 2.0 authorization grants
to define how the client can obtain access on behalf of a requesting party to
any number of protected resources residing within multiple security domains with
the minimum amount of user interaction.
