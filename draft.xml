    <abstract>
      <t>This specification defines a means for a client, representing a
        requesting party, to obtain authorization from an OAuth 2.0
        authorization server.  Once authorized, it defines means for that client
        to obtain access tokens to any protected resources that trust the
        authorization server.  This access is granted dynamically, potentially
        after initial authorization, effectively putting the client into a mode
        of continuous authorization.</t>

      <t>
        OAuth defines the refresh token in section 1.5 as:
        
        A refresh token is a string representing the authorization granted to
           the client by the resource owner.
      </t>
      
      <t>
        This profile extends the meaning of this to include a requesting party.
      </t>
      
      <t>
        The value of the scope parameter is expressed as a list of space-
           delimited, case-sensitive strings.  The strings are defined by the
           authorization server.
           
           Section 3.3.  This specificatin clarifies this to state that the
           scope is defined by the resource server
      </t>
      
      <t>
        the authorization server authenticates the resource owner and obtains
          an authorization decision (by asking the resource owner or by
          establishing approval via other means)  section 4.1.1
      </t>
      
      <t>
        The scope of the access request as described by
                 Section 3.3.  The requested scope MUST NOT include any scope
                 not originally granted by the resource owner, and if omitted is
                 treated as equal to the scope originally granted by the
                 resource owner.
        
                 Section 6.
                 
                 This specification clarifies "originally granted", chiefly to
                 remove the constraint.  This is in acknowledgement that the
                 resource owner's grant can change dynamically at any time, either
                 to decrease _or_ increase the scope of access.
      </t>
      
      <t>
        The refresh token is bound to the client and requesting party.
